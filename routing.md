# Routing

The plugin automatically scans all route files in your Laravel project, retrieves route names
and provides autocompletion for them. This ensures you can easily reference route names in your code.

The plugin offers route name autocompletion and resolving for the following methods:
* `route()`
* `to_route()`
* `signedRoute()`
* `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redirect::route()`
* `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redirect::signedRoute()`
* `Illuminate\Support\Facades\URL::route()`
* `Illuminate\Support\Facades\URL::signedRoute()`
